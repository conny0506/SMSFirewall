SMS Firewall is a native Android application developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. Designed to enhance user privacy, this application serves as a complete replacement for the stock Android "Messages" app, functioning as the device's Default SMS Handler.

The primary goal of this project is to combat unsolicited spam and advertisement messages. By intercepting incoming SMS traffic, the application analyzes message content in real-time and automatically filters out spam based on specific keywords (e.g., "Bet", "Casino", "Promotion", "Metin2").

Key Features:
Default SMS Handler: Fully replaces the native messaging app to gain full control over SMS reception and database management.

Smart Content Filtering: Automatically detects and blocks messages containing keywords related to illegal gambling, betting, and aggressive marketing.

Native Performance: Built entirely with Kotlin for optimal performance and system integration on Android devices.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean interface for viewing legitimate messages while keeping the spam folder separate.
